# Muse ID — Single Sign-On for audio.com + MuseHub — Design

**Date:** 2026-07-13
**Status:** Approved direction (user); spec pending user review
**Branch:** `feat/muse-id` (prototype repo) + changes in the two service repos

## Problem

The prototype talks to two real mock services, each with its own account, sign-in, and session: **moose-hub** (MuseHub spoof: wallet, plugin purchases, library) and **adieu** (audio.com spoof: cloud projects). Users sign in twice and hold two identities. We are introducing **Muse ID** — one neutral identity both services trust — without either service giving up its name.

**Decisions locked with the user:**
- **Symmetric-new**: Muse ID is a genuinely new account; existing service accounts LINK into it (no upgrade-in-place, no brand merger).
- **Verify-then-reveal**: nothing about existing accounts is disclosed until email ownership is proven (anti-enumeration; the email-entry response is identical whether accounts exist or not).
- **Linking ladder**: email match → linked in the same verification (free). Live service session → one-tap link (session is proof). Neither → deferred, contextual prompt (marketplace/library empty-state, account settings), never forced mid-flow.
- **Sign-out is global** (Muse session ends → both services' sandbox sessions end). **Unlink** is separate account surgery in settings.

## Repos involved

| Repo | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `muse-id` (NEW) | `~/Documents/webdev/muse-id` | identity provider service (Railway) |
| `moose-hub` | `~/Documents/webdev/moose-hub` | relying party: +exchange +internal lookup +migration |
| `adieu` | `~/Documents/webdev/adieu` | relying party: same additions |
| prototype | this repo, `feat/muse-id` | client: MuseIdContext, new auth UI, session plumbing |

House style (from recon, both services identical): Next.js 16 App Router + Prisma 6/Postgres + iron-session + bcryptjs + opaque DB tokens minted in `lib/oauth/tokens.ts`, validated per-route via `lib/oauth/bearer.ts::requireBearer`; vitest 2 unit+integration with per-file DB isolation; Railway NIXPACKS auto-deploy on push, `start = prisma migrate deploy && tsx prisma/seed.ts && next start`. **muse-id clones this style exactly.**

## Architecture

### Token model: exchange, not federation-by-JWT

Muse ID issues its own opaque tokens (same `tokens.ts` pattern). Services never validate Muse tokens per-request; instead each service adds ONE endpoint:

```
POST /api/auth/muse-exchange   { muse_access_token, legacy_access_token? }
```

Flow: introspect `muse_access_token` server-side against muse-id (S2S) → resolve the local user (by museId link → by legacy token if provided [live-session linking] → by verified-email match → JIT-provision) → mint the service's OWN opaque access+refresh pair via existing `tokens.ts` → return the service's standard token payload. Everything downstream (scopes, refresh rotation, revocation, both sandbox clients post-exchange) is untouched.

### Auth surface: where the user signs up vs signs in (amended 2026-07-13)

Muse ID has a **password** (the siblings both do; it makes password managers and the later passkey upgrade coherent). Emailed codes remain for signup verification, password reset, and future new-device checks — NOT for routine sign-in.

The app uses different mechanisms for the two moments, because the trade-off inverts between them:

| Moment | Mechanism | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Sign-up** (no account yet) | **In-app** — the existing `start`→`verify`→`complete` flow, password set at `complete` | A first-time user has no browser session to leverage, so a bounce is pure cost at the highest-drop-off moment (auth appears mid-task: saving to cloud / buying a plugin, not at launch). No existing credential to phish. First-party app ↔ first-party IdP is the recognised exception to "never collect credentials in-app", and is exactly what moose-hub/adieu already do with their direct-token grants. |
| **Sign-in** (returning) | **Browser-first** (`/authorize` + loopback per RFC 8252), with a visible "sign in here instead" in-app fallback | This is where SSO stickiness pays: a live muse-id cookie from audio.com/musehub.com turns sign-in into one click, no typing. Password managers fill it. The fallback guarantees nobody is stranded if the browser round-trip fails. |

Consequences: the 30-day refresh token means a signed-up user re-authenticates rarely, so the browser path naturally gets *better* over time (they'll have picked up a web session by then) without anyone being forced through it early. `/authorize` must exist for the **passkey** upgrade path later — passkeys are bound to the browser/OS credential store and cannot be collected in-app.

Note: moose-hub already seeds an `audacity-electron` OAuth client with a `127.0.0.1/callback` loopback redirect (RFC 8252), so the desktop bounce is pre-anticipated on the RP side.

### Using Muse ID to enter a service + the linking ladder (amended 2026-07-13, user decisions)

**"Continue with Muse ID" belongs on the SERVICE sign-in dialogs** (both MuseHub's and audio.com's), not on the Muse ID card itself — that is the third-party-IdP context where the idiom is correct ("use your Muse ID to get into this service"), and it is the actual payoff of SSO. Primary CTA above the demoted legacy email/password form.

Behaviour when clicked, by state:

| State | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Muse session + service already linked | Exchange tokens, straight in. No prompts. |
| Muse session + not linked + service account exists with the SAME email | Confirm before claiming: show the recognition card (see disclosure rule) and link on confirm. |
| Muse session + not linked + no service account | Create one under the Muse ID, stated plainly ("We'll set up your MuseHub account"). |
| Muse session + not linked + user's service account uses a DIFFERENT email | Do NOT silently create a duplicate (that orphans their real account — "my purchases are gone"). Offer rung 3 below. |
| No Muse session | Open the Muse ID dialog (create/sign-in), then re-enter the table. |

**Linking ladder (final):**
1. **Same email** — found automatically at signup discovery.
2. **Live in-app service session** — one tap; the existing session is the proof (no email round-trip).
3. **Different email — prove by code** *(user's addition)*: "Have an account under a different email? Add it" → enter email B → code sent to B → verified → that service account is linked. Same ownership standard as the primary email; user-initiated (only they know B exists); leaks nothing (a stranger typing an address just gets "code sent"). Available at the found-your-accounts step AND in Preferences → Accounts.
4. Otherwise create fresh — now a deliberate choice, never an accident.

**Email B is PROOF ONLY (user decision).** It is NOT stored as an alternate address on the Muse ID. One Muse ID = one email. No alias/alternate-address model.

Also in scope: after a user signs into a service with the LEGACY form while holding a Muse session, offer "Link this MuseHub account to your Muse ID?" — the same session-proof link at its natural moment; how existing users migrate without ever being forced.

### Disclosure rule for recognition cards (amended 2026-07-13, user decision)

Pre-link cards must show the LEAST that supports the "is this mine?" decision. **No financial data before linking.**
- Show: service name, **masked email** (e.g. `a.d•••@mu.se`), and a non-financial detail (`4 plugins`, `3 cloud projects`).
- Do NOT show: wallet balance (or any monetary value) pre-link. Balance appears only after linking, on the authenticated account card.
- Applies to the discovery payload itself: each RP's `/api/internal/lookup` returns the masked email + non-financial summary; muse-id passes it through unchanged.

Note: the flow is not stranger-reachable (discovery is gated behind a code sent to that address), but in MOCK_EMAIL_CODES demo mode the fixed code makes it appear so — a demo artifact to call out when presenting.

### muse-id service surface

Public (consumed by the sandbox):
- `POST /api/auth/start` `{ email }` → always `{ ok: true }` (sends/mocks a 6-digit code; identical response whether accounts exist — anti-enumeration). Fixed code `000000` when `MOCK_EMAIL_CODES=1`.
- `POST /api/auth/verify` `{ email, code }` → on success: if Muse ID exists → session + tokens (sign-in); if not → `{ status: 'new', discovery }` where `discovery` lists linkable service accounts found by email (safe: email is now proven). Max 5 attempts, 15-min TTL (PendingSignup pattern from moose-hub).
- `POST /api/auth/complete` `{ email, name, password, avatarChoice?, links: [{service, method: 'email-match'|'session', legacy_access_token?}] }` → creates the Muse ID **with a password** (bcrypt, cost 10, min length 8 — house policy from the siblings), executes links, returns muse tokens + profile. Caller-bound to the verify step by the `pendingEmail` session marker.
- `POST /api/auth/signin` `{ email, password, client_id }` → email+password grant → tokens + session (mirrors the siblings' `direct-token` route). **No code required on sign-in** — codes are for signup, password reset, and (future) new-device only.
- `GET /api/oauth/userinfo` (Bearer) → `{ sub, email, name, avatarUrl, linkedServices: [...] }`.
- `POST /api/link` (Bearer) `{ service, legacy_access_token }` → session-proof or credential-proof linking after creation (settings / deferred prompts).
- `POST /api/unlink` (Bearer) `{ service }`.
- `POST /api/oauth/token` (refresh rotation) + `POST /api/oauth/revoke` — same shapes as the siblings. **Revoke parses JSON AND form-urlencoded** (learning from moose-hub's revoke bug).

Server-to-server (RP secret per service via env, `Authorization: Bearer <RP_SECRET>`):
- `POST /api/s2s/introspect` `{ token }` → `{ active, sub, email, name }` (RFC 7662-ish).
- muse-id → services: `GET /api/internal/lookup?email=` on each service (new internal route there, same RP secret) → `{ exists, userId?, display: { name, summary } }` where `summary` is the found-your-accounts card copy (e.g. `"wallet $12.40 · 5 plugins"` / `"7 cloud projects"`). Called only after verification, from `/api/auth/verify`.

Data model (Prisma): `User` (id cuid, email unique, name, avatarUrl?, **passwordHash** (bcryptjs cost 10, as siblings), createdAt), `PendingVerification` (email PK, codeHash, expiresAt, attempts, lastSentAt), `LinkedAccount` (id, userId, service enum('moose-hub','adieu'), serviceUserId, linkedAt, @@unique([userId, service]), @@unique([service, serviceUserId])), `AccessToken`/`RefreshToken`/`OAuthClient` (as siblings). Seed: OAuth client `audacity-web-demo`; NO seed users (creation is the demo).

### Relying-party changes (each of moose-hub, adieu)

1. Migration: `User.museId String? @unique`; `passwordHash` → nullable (Muse-born users have none; guard password sign-in against null).
2. `POST /api/auth/muse-exchange` (above; grants the service's standard default scope — moose-hub `profile library:read wallet:write`, adieu `profile projects:write`).
3. `GET /api/internal/lookup` (RP-secret-gated; returns existence + card summary; NEVER exposed to browsers — no CORS).
4. Env: `MUSE_ID_BASE_URL`, `MUSE_RP_SECRET`. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` unchanged (exchange is called by the sandbox, same origins).
5. Linking write = set `museId` on the local user (exchange/link paths); unlink = null it. muse-id's `LinkedAccount` is the authoritative directory for the account-settings UI; the `museId` column is the service-side join.
6. Legacy auth untouched and parallel-running (real-migration realism).

### Sandbox (prototype app)

- `lib/muse-id-client.ts` (house client style: token storage `muse-id-tokens-v1`, refresh-on-401 against muse-id).
- `MuseIdContext` — owns the Muse session + profile + linkedServices. On successful Muse sign-in/creation: calls each linked service's `/api/auth/muse-exchange`, hands the resulting service tokens to the EXISTING `MuseHubContext`/`AdieuContext` (they keep their own token stores and all downstream behavior — additive shim, e.g. `adoptTokens(tokens)` added to each).
- New UI: `MuseIdAuthDialog` (email → code → found-your-accounts cards [email-match rung pre-checked; session rung shown when a legacy in-app session exists] → profile step only on name/avatar conflict → done). Account surfaces (HomeTab account card, UserMenu, Preferences Accounts page) show ONE Muse identity with per-service sections + "Linked services" management (link/unlink). Marketplace/library and cloud empty-states gain the deferred "Have an existing account? Link it" prompt.
- Global sign-out: Muse sign-out revokes muse tokens AND calls both services' existing revoke/clears both legacy stores.
- Legacy dialogs (`AdieuAuthDialog`, wallet `AuthDialog`) remain reachable behind a debug toggle (regression path + demo contrast) but the primary CTA everywhere becomes "Continue with Muse ID".

### Phase 6 — the browser OAuth flow: Muse ID on the services' OWN web login pages (amended 2026-07-20, user decision "I need to walk through the ENTIRE workflow")

The in-app (DAW) side of SSO is built via token-exchange. The WEB side — musehub.com's and audio.com's own login pages offering "Continue with Muse ID" — needs the real OAuth authorization-code + PKCE browser redirect (a web page cannot use the in-app exchange). This is the deferred "browser-first sign-in" / RFC 8252 half.

**muse-id becomes a real OAuth Identity Provider:**
- New `AuthCode` model + migration; copy `lib/oauth/{authorize.ts, pkce.ts}` from moose-hub (the proven reference — muse-id already has the sibling tokens.ts/bearer.ts).
- `GET /authorize` page: validates client_id/redirect_uri/PKCE(S256)/response_type=code against registered clients; if no muse session → send to muse-id sign-in with `next`; if session → show a **streamlined first-party consent** (user decision): "Continue to MuseHub as Alex" / "Continue to audio.com as Alex" — a single continue button + a cancel, NOT a scope-by-scope third-party consent screen (these are all Muse's own properties; consent screens are for third parties). On continue → mint AuthCode (60s TTL) → redirect back with code+state.
- Extend `POST /api/oauth/token` to handle `grant_type=authorization_code` (single-use code consume in a transaction, PKCE verifyChallenge, client+redirect match) alongside the existing refresh grant.
- Seed OAuth clients: `musehub-web` (redirect `http://localhost:3000/oauth/museid/callback`) and `adieu-web` (`http://localhost:3001/oauth/museid/callback`); keep `audacity-web-demo` (redirect `http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback`) for the DAW browser-first path.

**Each service's web login page (moose-hub, adieu) becomes an OAuth client of muse-id:**
- `/login` page gains "Continue with Muse ID" (primary) above the legacy form (mirrors the in-app dialog's hierarchy). Clicking it starts the redirect: generate PKCE verifier (store in a short-lived httpOnly cookie/state), redirect to `museid/authorize`.
- New callback route `/oauth/museid/callback`: verify state, exchange code→muse tokens at `museid/api/oauth/token`, introspect/resolve the local user via the SAME resolution logic as `/api/auth/muse-exchange` (museId match → email match → JIT provision; reuse, don't fork), set the service's own iron-session cookie, redirect to the app home signed in. Legacy `/login` password path untouched.

**DAW browser-first sign-in (sandbox):** the Muse ID auth dialog's sign-IN path gains "Continue with Muse ID" that redirects the browser to `museid/authorize?client_id=audacity-web-demo&redirect_uri=…5173/oauth/callback`; the EXISTING `components/OAuthCallback.tsx` handles the return (code→muse tokens→establish Muse session→exchange+adopt both services). In-app create/password path stays as the fallback.

**Walkthrough this enables (the "entire workflow"):** create a Muse ID in the DAW → open musehub.com → "Continue with Muse ID" → museid consent → back on musehub.com signed in with the same identity; and the reverse (browser-first Muse ID sign-in from the DAW).

## Security rules (bind all tasks)

- No account existence/details disclosure before email verification (identical `/api/auth/start` responses; discovery only in `/api/auth/verify` success).
- Session-proof linking requires a VALID legacy access token, verified server-side by the RP during exchange/link (the RP validates its own token — no trust in client claims).
- Verification codes: hashed at rest (sha256, house style), TTL 15 min, 5 attempts; `MOCK_EMAIL_CODES=1` fixes the code for demos, real Resend path optional.
- S2S routes: RP-secret gated, no CORS headers, never callable from browsers.
- No secrets in code or specs; env names only.

## Demo script (staged by EXISTING seeds — no contrivance)

moose-hub seeds `a.dawson@mu.se` (wallet 4250¢, 4 plugins); adieu seeds `a.dawson@adieu.com` (3 projects). Demo: sign into adieu the old way (or arrive with the session) → "Continue with Muse ID" → enter `a.dawson@mu.se` → code `000000` → found-your-accounts shows **moose-hub card (email match)** + **adieu card (offered via live session, different email)** → confirm both → one account card in Home with wallet AND projects → global sign-out kills everything.

## Non-goals

- Real email delivery in demos (mock code), real OAuth consent hardening, brand/name changes to either service, migrating legacy auth off (parallel-run is the point), production-grade key management, account deletion/GDPR flows, the sandbox's dead musehub-client `projects*` methods (backlog), fixing moose-hub's revoke content-type bug is IN scope only as a rider (one-line, disclosed) since the exchange work touches that area.

## Testing

- muse-id: full vitest suite in house style (unit: codes, tokens, linking invariants incl. the two @@unique constraints; integration: start/verify/complete happy + enumeration-response-identity + attempt limits + both linking rungs + unlink).
- Each RP: integration tests for `muse-exchange` (museId hit, legacy-token link, email match, JIT provision, bad muse token, null-passwordHash sign-in guard) + `internal/lookup` (secret required).
- Sandbox: extend the integration net — `MuseId.integration.test.tsx` with the muse-id client mocked at the same boundary style as audioMock (the services are network mocks in jsdom): full dialog flow, both rungs, global sign-out, contexts adopting exchanged tokens. Existing 372-test suite stays green (legacy paths untouched).
- Deployed smoke: the demo script run manually against Railway once everything ships.

## Deploy checklist (user does the dashboard parts)

1. I create `~/Documents/webdev/muse-id` repo + GitHub remote (`gh`).
2. You: Railway → new project + Postgres → connect the GitHub repo (NIXPACKS; it'll pick up railway.json like moose-hub's).
3. You: set env on muse-id (`DATABASE_URL` via Railway PG, `SESSION_SECRET`, `MOCK_EMAIL_CODES=1`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` incl. the sandbox origins, `MUSE_RP_SECRET`) and add to BOTH services (`MUSE_ID_BASE_URL`, `MUSE_RP_SECRET` — same value).
4. Sandbox env: `VITE_MUSEID_BASE_URL` (localhost:3002 default; Railway URL for deployed demo).
5. Ports locally: moose-hub 3000, adieu 3001, muse-id 3002.

## Acceptance

- Demo script works end-to-end against local services AND deployed Railway.
- All four repos' suites green (prototype 372+ / both services' existing suites + new tests / muse-id new suite); prototype gates (tsc, guard, CI) green.
- Enumeration check: `/api/auth/start` responses byte-identical for existing vs unknown emails (integration-tested).
- Legacy sign-in still works in both services (parallel-run proven by existing tests staying green).
