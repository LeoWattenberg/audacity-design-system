---

## Apps (`apps/`)

| App | Directory | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| `@audacity-ui/sandbox` | `apps/sandbox/` | Vite + React 19 full UI — the primary development and testing target; dev server on port 5173; run tests with `pnpm --filter @audacity-ui/sandbox test` |

## Where State Lives (`apps/sandbox/src/contexts/`)

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `TracksContext.tsx` | Hub for all track/clip state. Holds the state shape, the `TracksProvider`, and the outer `tracksReducer` (which owns UNDO/REDO + undo-history coalescing). Domain mutation logic is **not** here — it lives in `contexts/reducers/` (see below). Most audio-editing state flows through here |
| `DialogContext.tsx` | Dialog open/close state (wraps `useDialogState` hook); replaces prop drilling of ~15 dialog states |
| `ContextMenuContext.tsx` | Context-menu visibility and positioning (wraps `useContextMenuState` hook); manages 8 menu types |
| `SpectralSelectionContext.tsx` | Spectral selection read/write — 6 properties |
| `AudioEngineContext.tsx` | Audio engine service (refs + methods, no React state) |
| `PlaybackContext.tsx` | Value-provider for playback (`usePlayback()`): App calls `usePlaybackControls` and provides its return — consumers read `audioManagerRef`/`isPlaying`/etc. from context instead of drilled props |
| `LoopRegionContext.tsx` | Value-provider for loop-region drag/resize (`useLoopRegionContext()`): App calls `useLoopRegion` (needs App-local `timeSelection`/`bpm`/`beatsPerMeasure`) and provides its return, same pattern as `PlaybackContext` |

User preferences state is the exception — it lives in the components package, not here: `packages/components/src/contexts/PreferencesContext.tsx` (consumed app-wide via `usePreferences`). It's now split into domain-slice hooks over the same provider — `useGeneralPrefs()`, `useAppearancePrefs()`, `useEditingBehaviorPrefs()` — so consumers that only need one slice don't re-render on unrelated preference changes; `usePreferences()` still returns the full value for existing callers.

### Tracks reducer — domain split (`apps/sandbox/src/contexts/reducers/`)

`tracksReducer` is two layers: the **outer** wrapper in `TracksContext.tsx` (undo/redo + coalescing) delegates all domain logic to `innerReducer`, which is pure routing — it maps each action to one domain via `domains.ts` and calls that domain's sub-reducer. To change how an action behaves, edit its domain reducer; to add an action, add it to the `TracksAction` union, map it in `domains.ts` (the `Record<TracksAction['type'], Domain>` type fails the build if you forget), and handle it in the domain reducer.

| File | Domain / responsibility |
|---|---|
| `domains.ts` | `ACTION_DOMAIN` — the action→domain routing table (compiler-enforced exhaustive) |
| `tracksDomainReducer.ts` | Track add/update/delete/move/height/view/ruler/spectrogram |
| `clipsReducer.ts` | Clip add/update/delete/move/trim/stretch/placement, group/ungroup, labels, time-range cut |
| `selectionReducer.ts` | Clip/track/label selection, focus, hovered point |
| `envelopeReducer.ts` | Envelope points + envelope mode toggles |
| `effectsReducer.ts` | Track + master effects chains |
| `midiReducer.ts` | Piano-roll + MIDI note/clip actions |
| `viewReducer.ts` | View modes, playhead, time selection, cut mode, snap |
| `recordingReducer.ts` | Recording start/stop/meters |

Behavior is locked by `__tests__/tracksReducer.characterization.test.ts` and `__tests__/reducerRouting.test.ts`.

## Where Interactions Live

### Drag / gesture hooks (`apps/sandbox/src/hooks/`)

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `useClipDragging.ts` | Clip drag with multi-select support |
| `useClipTrimming.ts` | Clip left/right edge trimming |
| `useClipStretching.ts` | Clip time-stretching |
| `useMarqueeSelection.ts` | Rubber-band marquee selection |
| `useZoomControls.ts` | Zoom in/out, fit-to-window |
| `useGrabToPan.ts` | Middle-click / grab-to-pan scrolling |
| `useLoopRegion.ts` | Loop region drag and resize |
| `useLabelDragging.ts` | Label drag interactions |
| `useSplitTool.ts` | Split-mode click-to-split tool — state, Shift-sync + hover effects, and the split mouse-handler branches (extracted from Canvas; wired back into Canvas's guard chain in order) |
| `useCanvasPointerHandlers.ts` | Canvas's nine mouse handlers (mousedown/move/up/contextmenu across clips, labels, marquee, split) — extracted verbatim from Canvas |
| `useDragHighlightIds.ts` | Derives `draggingClipIds` (mouse-drag ghosting) / `raisedClipIds` (Cmd+Arrow z-index lift) that Canvas uses to highlight clips mid-drag |
| `useTrackKeyboardHandlers.ts` | Track-level vertical navigation + selection keyboard handling |
| `useCmdArrowMove.ts` | Cmd/Ctrl-release overlap resolution for Cmd+Arrow clip moves — listens for keyup, reconciles final clip positions against neighbors |
| `useDraggableToolbar.ts` | Transport toolbar gripper-drag: floating position + top/bottom dock snapping |
| `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` | **Keyboard routing hub** — delegates to domain handlers below |

**EditorLayout effect hooks** (extracted from EditorLayout; each a self-contained `useEffect`):
| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `usePianoRollSmoothScroll.ts` | RAF ease-out scroll to the selected MIDI clip; returns `skipPianoRollScrollRef` |
| `useAutoOpenPianoRoll.ts` | Opens the piano roll when a MIDI track gains focus |
| `useDrawerTabAutoSwitch.ts` | Switches the bottom-drawer tab when mixer/piano-roll open/close |
| `useTimeSelectionTabHandler.ts` | Global keydown: Tab behavior during a time selection |
| `useFlatNavTabRouter.ts` | Global keydown: flat-nav Tab interception + DOM-ordered focus routing |

**App effect/state hooks** (extracted from App.tsx): `useFocusDebugger`, `useMixerPanelListener`, `useTimeCodeFormats`, `useLocalStorageBackedState<T>`, `useInitialTrackSelection`, `useProjectAutoSave`, `useCloudProjectCleanup` — each a self-contained state/effect cluster. Big handler flows (side-effectful — DOM/network/toasts/IndexedDB; take explicit deps objects) live in `utils/`: `generateTone.ts`, `importAudio.ts`, `saveCloudProject.ts`.

**App.tsx orchestration hooks** (later extraction pass — the cloud-load flow, menu wiring, and scroll/zoom sync that used to be inline in App.tsx):
| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `useProjectLifecycle.ts` | New/open/close/delete project flow, including cloud-project loading and the missing-plugins scan on open |
| `useMenuDefinitions.ts` | Builds the in-app menu definition tree (File/Edit/View/etc.) from current app state and callbacks |
| `useElectronMenuBridge.ts` | Routes native Electron menu clicks to the same handlers the in-app menu uses, by label lookup; desktop-only |
| `useCanvasScrollSync.ts` | Wheel-zoom and two-pane (canvas + track-header) scroll sync |
| `useMasterMeter.ts` | Master output meter + master volume, reading the audio engine's dedicated master `Tone.Meter` |
| `useAudioDeviceMenu.ts` | "Audio setup" menu anchor + selected recording/playback device + available `MediaDeviceInfo` lists |
| `usePlugins.ts` | Plugin list state, syncing installed/disabled effects, missing-plugin detection on project load |

Pure geometry helpers used by Canvas + the split tool live in `apps/sandbox/src/utils/canvasGeometry.ts` (`resolveTrackIndexFromY`, `buildSplitForTrack`). Other extracted `utils/`: `canvasLayout.ts` (Canvas layout math), `snapGuideline.ts` (snap-guideline time calculation for trim/stretch), `clipKeyboardEdit.ts` (keyboard trim/stretch batch + announcement text, used by `CanvasTrackList`), `envelopePointSizes.ts` (projects an `EnvelopePointStyle` profile down to the size fields Canvas needs), `findMissingEffects.ts` (scans a project for effects the user doesn't have installed), `cloudProjects.ts` (loads a cloud project into the `StoredProject` shape). `packages/components/src/ClipBody/waveformGeometry.ts` holds the equivalent pure waveform-pixel-geometry helpers for `ClipBody`.

### Keyboard handlers (`apps/sandbox/src/hooks/handlers/`)

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `clipboardHandlers.ts` | Cut / copy / paste |
| `deleteHandlers.ts` | Delete / clear selection |
| `navigationHandlers.ts` | Arrow keys, Home/End, J/K clip-edge nav |
| `playheadSelectionHandlers.ts` | Playhead move, selection extend |
| `transportHandlers.ts` | Space/play/stop/record transport keys |
| `trackCreationHandlers.ts` | Cmd+T / Shift+T / Shift+L — new mono/stereo/label track |
| `splitHandlers.ts` | Cmd+I / Cmd+Shift+I — split clip(s) at the playhead |
| `duplicateHandlers.ts` | Cmd/Ctrl+D — duplicate focused clip(s)/track(s) |
| `effectsPanelHandlers.ts` | E — toggle effects panel with focus capture/restore |

`useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` remains the dispatcher: one ordered `keydown` guard chain that delegates to these modules. Escape, Cmd+Arrow clip-move, and ArrowUp/Down are still inline (order-coupled focus logic, deferred).

## Where Rendering Happens

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `packages/components/src/Track/TrackNew.tsx` | Component-based track renderer — lays out clips, positions EnvelopeInteractionLayer overlays |
| `packages/components/src/ClipBody/ClipBody.tsx` | Canvas-based clip body — waveform, spectrogram, and envelope fill drawing. Pure pixel-geometry math split into `packages/components/src/ClipBody/waveformGeometry.ts` |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/GridOverlay.tsx` | Beat/measure grid SVG overlay (extracted from Canvas); exports pure `computeGrid` |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/Canvas.tsx` | Main rendering coordinator — manages track layout, time/spectral selection, coordinates `CanvasTrackList` and overlay rendering (see also: known debt below) |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/canvas/CanvasTrackList.tsx` | Owns the per-track render loop — maps `tracks` to `TrackNew` + `LabelRenderer`, wiring clip/label/envelope props and ~10 tracks-reducer dispatch types directly (deliberate: mirrors how Canvas.tsx did it pre-refactor, not a new coupling). Extracted verbatim from Canvas.tsx; see also: known debt below |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/canvas/MarqueeRect.tsx` | Right-drag marquee-selection rectangle overlay |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/canvas/SnapGuideline.tsx` | 1px vertical guideline shown at the snap target during trim/stretch |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/canvas/SplitPreviewLine.tsx` | Split-tool hover preview line (single track, or all tracks with Shift held) |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/ProjectToolbarContainer.tsx` | Wires `ProjectToolbar` — project menu (home/project/export/debug), mixer/audio-setup/marketplace triggers |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/TransportToolbarContainer.tsx` | Wires `TransportToolbar` — playback/mode toggles, zoom, snap, timecode, master meter, toolbar-gripper drag |
| `packages/components/src/PreferencesModal/PreferencesModal.tsx` | 210-line scaffold — tab list + active-page routing — delegating to 10 page components in `PreferencesModal/pages/` (`GeneralPage`, `AppearancePage`, `AudioSettingsPage`, `PlaybackRecordingPage`, `SpectralDisplayPage`, `EditingPage`, `PluginsPage`, `CloudPage`, `ShortcutsPage`, `PlaceholderPage`) plus shared `TabGroupField.tsx`, `types.ts`, `menuItems.ts` |

## `any` Guardrail (`scripts/check-any.mjs`)

A dependency-free Node script that enforces a zero-untracked-`any` policy across `apps/sandbox/src/**` and `packages/*/src/**` (excluding `__tests__`, `*.test.*`, `dist`, and `node_modules`). It flags lines matching `: any\b`, `as any\b`, or `<any[,>]` unless the line also carries a `// justified:` comment explaining why the `any` is intentional (e.g. `// justified: Tone.js types incomplete — pending audio-package sweep`). A clean tree exits 0 and prints a file-count summary; violations exit 1 with `file:line: <line>` output and the message `every \`any\` needs a \`// justified:\` comment — see docs/codebase-map.md`. Run it with `pnpm guard:any` from the repo root. The script is also chained into `apps/sandbox`'s `test` script so it runs on every `pnpm test` invocation. ESLint adoption (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`) is the natural next step but is out of scope for this slice.

## Big-and-Scary Files (Known Debt)

These are not-yet-decomposed monoliths. They work but are prime targets for future extraction.

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `apps/sandbox/src/App.tsx` (1244 lines) | Application root — provider tree, routing, and remaining orchestration. The cloud-load flow, menu wiring, and wheel-zoom/scroll sync that used to be inline here are now extracted (`useProjectLifecycle`, `useMenuDefinitions` + `useElectronMenuBridge`, `useCanvasScrollSync` — see "App.tsx orchestration hooks" above), along with `PlaybackContext`, `LoopRegionContext`, `useMasterMeter`, `useAudioDeviceMenu`, `usePlugins`, and the toolbar prop-wiring in `ProjectToolbarContainer`/`TransportToolbarContainer`. Remaining bulk is provider-tree assembly and the local state that still fans out to those extracted pieces |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/EditorLayout.tsx` | Full editor chrome (toolbar, track panel, ruler, transport, drawer). Consumes `TracksContext` directly via `useTracks()` (typed — no `state`/`dispatch` prop-drill); self-contained effects extracted to hooks. Remaining bulk is layout JSX / prop-drilling to already-extracted child components — reducing it needs a selection/focus context (separate project) |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/Canvas.tsx` (771 lines) | Track/clip/label interaction dispatcher (renders no `<canvas>`). Grid → `GridOverlay`, split tool → `useSplitTool`, geometry → `utils/canvasGeometry`, pointer handlers → `useCanvasPointerHandlers`, track-nav keyboard → `useTrackKeyboardHandlers`, and the per-track render loop → `components/canvas/CanvasTrackList.tsx` are now extracted. Remaining bulk is state wiring across those pieces |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/canvas/CanvasTrackList.tsx` (774 lines) | The per-track render loop extracted from Canvas.tsx — still coupled to ~10 tracks-reducer dispatch types directly (clip move/trim/stretch, label update, envelope points, etc.) rather than going through a narrower prop interface. This is a deliberate verbatim relocation, not new debt: reducing it needs the same Context-slicing change Canvas.tsx would have needed |
