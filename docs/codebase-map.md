## Packages (`packages/`)

| Published name | Directory | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| `@audacity-ui/core` | `packages/core/` | Shared TypeScript interfaces and accessibility utilities (tab groups, roving tabindex, a11y profiles) |
| `@audacity-ui/tokens` | `packages/tokens/` | Design tokens — theme definitions, color palettes, typography values |
| `@dilsonspickles/components` | `packages/components/` | 100+ UI components: ClipDisplay, TrackNew, EnvelopeInteractionLayer, EffectsPanel, rulers, overlays, etc. |
| `@audacity-ui/audio` | `packages/audio/` | Tone.js-backed audio playback; entry point is `packages/audio/src/AudioPlaybackManager.ts` |

---

## Apps (`apps/`)

| App | Directory | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| `@audacity-ui/sandbox` | `apps/sandbox/` | Vite + React 19 full UI — the primary development and testing target; dev server on port 5173; run tests with `pnpm --filter @audacity-ui/sandbox test` |
| Desktop | `apps/desktop/` | Electron wrapper around the built sandbox; main process entry is `apps/desktop/src/main.cjs` |
| `@audacity-ui/docs` | `apps/docs/` | Storybook component documentation site |
| `@dilsonspickles/static-smoke` | `apps/static-smoke/` | Standalone-render regression page for smoke-testing component output without the full app |

---

## Where State Lives (`apps/sandbox/src/contexts/`)

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `TracksContext.tsx` | Hub for all track/clip state. Holds the state shape, the `TracksProvider`, and the outer `tracksReducer` (which owns UNDO/REDO + undo-history coalescing). Domain mutation logic is **not** here — it lives in `contexts/reducers/` (see below). Most audio-editing state flows through here |
| `DialogContext.tsx` | Dialog open/close state (wraps `useDialogState` hook); replaces prop drilling of ~15 dialog states |
| `ContextMenuContext.tsx` | Context-menu visibility and positioning (wraps `useContextMenuState` hook); manages 8 menu types |
| `SpectralSelectionContext.tsx` | Spectral selection read/write — 6 properties |
| `AudioEngineContext.tsx` | Audio engine service (refs + methods, no React state) |

User preferences state is the exception — it lives in the components package, not here: `packages/components/src/contexts/PreferencesContext.tsx` (consumed app-wide via `usePreferences`; not yet decomposed into domain-specific contexts — see known debt).

### Tracks reducer — domain split (`apps/sandbox/src/contexts/reducers/`)

`tracksReducer` is two layers: the **outer** wrapper in `TracksContext.tsx` (undo/redo + coalescing) delegates all domain logic to `innerReducer`, which is pure routing — it maps each action to one domain via `domains.ts` and calls that domain's sub-reducer. To change how an action behaves, edit its domain reducer; to add an action, add it to the `TracksAction` union, map it in `domains.ts` (the `Record<TracksAction['type'], Domain>` type fails the build if you forget), and handle it in the domain reducer.

| File | Domain / responsibility |
|---|---|
| `domains.ts` | `ACTION_DOMAIN` — the action→domain routing table (compiler-enforced exhaustive) |
| `tracksDomainReducer.ts` | Track add/update/delete/move/height/view/ruler/spectrogram |
| `clipsReducer.ts` | Clip add/update/delete/move/trim/stretch/placement, group/ungroup, labels, time-range cut |
| `selectionReducer.ts` | Clip/track/label selection, focus, hovered point |
| `envelopeReducer.ts` | Envelope points + envelope mode toggles |
| `effectsReducer.ts` | Track + master effects chains |
| `midiReducer.ts` | Piano-roll + MIDI note/clip actions |
| `viewReducer.ts` | View modes, playhead, time selection, cut mode, snap |
| `recordingReducer.ts` | Recording start/stop/meters |

Behavior is locked by `__tests__/tracksReducer.characterization.test.ts` and `__tests__/reducerRouting.test.ts`.

## Where Interactions Live

### Drag / gesture hooks (`apps/sandbox/src/hooks/`)

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `useClipDragging.ts` | Clip drag with multi-select support |
| `useClipTrimming.ts` | Clip left/right edge trimming |
| `useClipStretching.ts` | Clip time-stretching |
| `useMarqueeSelection.ts` | Rubber-band marquee selection |
| `useZoomControls.ts` | Zoom in/out, fit-to-window |
| `useGrabToPan.ts` | Middle-click / grab-to-pan scrolling |
| `useLoopRegion.ts` | Loop region drag and resize |
| `useLabelDragging.ts` | Label drag interactions |
| `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` | **Keyboard routing hub** — delegates to domain handlers below |

### Keyboard handlers (`apps/sandbox/src/hooks/handlers/`)

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `clipboardHandlers.ts` | Cut / copy / paste |
| `deleteHandlers.ts` | Delete / clear selection |
| `navigationHandlers.ts` | Arrow keys, Home/End, J/K clip-edge nav |
| `playheadSelectionHandlers.ts` | Playhead move, selection extend |
| `transportHandlers.ts` | Space/play/stop/record transport keys |
| `trackCreationHandlers.ts` | Cmd+T / Shift+T / Shift+L — new mono/stereo/label track |
| `splitHandlers.ts` | Cmd+I / Cmd+Shift+I — split clip(s) at the playhead |
| `duplicateHandlers.ts` | Cmd/Ctrl+D — duplicate focused clip(s)/track(s) |
| `effectsPanelHandlers.ts` | E — toggle effects panel with focus capture/restore |

`useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` remains the dispatcher: one ordered `keydown` guard chain that delegates to these modules. Escape, Cmd+Arrow clip-move, and ArrowUp/Down are still inline (order-coupled focus logic, deferred).

## Where Rendering Happens

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `packages/components/src/Track/TrackNew.tsx` | Component-based track renderer — lays out clips, positions EnvelopeInteractionLayer overlays |
| `packages/components/src/ClipBody/ClipBody.tsx` | Canvas-based clip body — waveform, spectrogram, and envelope fill drawing |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/Canvas.tsx` | Main rendering coordinator — manages track layout, time/spectral selection, coordinates TrackNew components and label rendering (see also: known debt below) |

---

## Big-and-Scary Files (Known Debt)

These are not-yet-decomposed monoliths. They work but are prime targets for future extraction.

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `apps/sandbox/src/App.tsx` | Application root — wires up provider tree and top-level routing; accumulates bootstrap concerns |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/EditorLayout.tsx` | Full editor chrome — toolbar, track panel, ruler, transport bar all in one component; not yet split by region |
| `apps/sandbox/src/components/Canvas.tsx` | Track/clip/label rendering coordinator and interaction dispatcher; multiple concerns not yet separated |
| `packages/components/src/PreferencesModal/PreferencesModal.tsx` | Preferences UI; all preference panels in one file |
