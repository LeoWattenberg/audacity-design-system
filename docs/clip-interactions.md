# Clip Interaction Behaviors

## Click Interactions

### Clip Header
**Location**: The top 20px bar of a clip containing the clip name and menu button

**Behaviors**:
- **Regular Click**: Selects the clip exclusively (deselects all other clips) and selects the parent track. Creates a time selection spanning the clip's duration.
- **Shift+Click**: Toggles the clip's selection state (multi-select). Creates a time selection spanning all selected clips from earliest start to latest end. Selects the parent track.
- **Click on Menu Button**: Opens the clip context menu (does not select the clip)

### Clip Body
**Location**: The main waveform/envelope area below the header

**Behaviors**:
- **Click**: No selection behavior - used for envelope editing when envelope mode is active
- **Envelope Mode ON**: Clicking near the envelope line adds/removes/drags envelope points
- **Envelope Mode OFF**: Click has no effect on selection

## Keyboard Interactions

### Enter Key (on focused clip)
- **Enter**: Same as regular click on clip header - selects clip exclusively
- **Shift+Enter**: Same as shift+click on clip header - toggles clip selection

## Selection States

### Single Clip Selected
- Clip shows selected border
- Parent track is selected
- Time selection shows in timeline ruler spanning the clip's duration

### Multiple Clips Selected (Shift+Click)
- All selected clips show selected border
- Parent track of most recently clicked clip is selected
- Time selection shows in timeline ruler spanning from earliest clip start to latest clip end

### No Clips Selected
- No selected borders
- No time selection in timeline ruler

## Time Selection Calculation

**Single Clip**:
```
startTime = clip.start
endTime = clip.start + clip.duration
```

**Multiple Clips**:
```
startTime = Math.min(...selectedClips.map(c => c.start))
endTime = Math.max(...selectedClips.map(c => c.start + c.duration))
```

## Implementation Details

- Clip selection is handled by `onClipClick` callback in `TrackNew` component
- Callback signature: `onClipClick(clipId, shiftKey)`
- Canvas.tsx dispatches:
  - `SELECT_CLIP` action when `shiftKey === false` (exclusive selection)
  - `TOGGLE_CLIP_SELECTION` action when `shiftKey === true` (multi-select)
- Both actions also dispatch `SELECT_TRACK` to select the parent track
- TracksContext reducers calculate and set the `timeSelection` state
- Timeline ruler displays the time selection as a highlighted region

## Clip-group copy semantics

**Invariant:** copies never share a group with their originals. Copies form a
fresh group of their own iff every member of the original group was copied
whole (untrimmed) — otherwise they are ungrouped. A fresh group that would
have fewer than 2 members dissolves to ungrouped.

| Operation | Group situation | Copies come out |
|---|---|---|
| Ctrl+D clip(s) | whole group (selection auto-expands) | fresh group |
| Duplicate track | group entirely on duplicated track(s) | fresh group |
| Duplicate track | group spans a non-duplicated track | ungrouped |
| Copy/cut → paste | whole group in clipboard | fresh group (per paste) |
| Copy/cut → paste | partial members in clipboard | ungrouped |
| Time-selection copy/cut → paste | all members covered whole + untrimmed | fresh group |
| Time-selection copy/cut → paste | any member sliced or omitted | ungrouped |
| Any | fresh group would have <2 members | ungrouped |

**Source-side corollary:** cut, delete-clip, delete-time-range, delete-track,
and overlap-resolution deletion (a dropped clip fully covering a group member)
dissolve any surviving group that drops below 2 members.

Implementation: `apps/sandbox/src/utils/clipGroupCopy.ts` (entirety +
regrouping), `dissolveDegenerateGroups` in `contexts/reducers/shared.ts`.

## Time-selection scope

Time selection and track selection are independent axes. Dragging a time
selection never changes the track selection; the drag's vertical scope is
carried on the selection itself (`TimeSelection.tracks`). Keyboard-created
selections are scoped to the focused track; edits (edge drags, Shift+Arrow
nudges) preserve the existing scope. Label expansion stamps an all-tracks
scope; Shift+Click range select stamps the rows it spans.

**Scope resolution** (`apps/sandbox/src/utils/timeSelectionScope.ts`), used
by delete-time-range, time-selection copy/cut (including clip-group
whole-capture), Cmd+Arrow promotes, and drag-clip-into-selection:
`timeSelection.tracks` → `selectedTrackIndices` → operation default
(all tracks, or the focused track for promotes).

"Set selection to loop" (timeline ruler context menu) deliberately creates a
scopeless selection — it's a timeline-level action, so operations on it fall
back to `selectedTrackIndices`, then all tracks.

**Scope editing:** Cmd+Click or Cmd+Enter on a track panel row toggles that
row in/out of an active scope (track selection untouched); with no active
scope they toggle track selection as before. Deleting or reordering tracks
remaps the scope; a scope emptied by track deletion clears the selection.

Rendering (`TrackNew`): in-scope rows get the bright band; selected
out-of-scope rows a subtle white wash; unselected out-of-scope rows the dim
band.

Design doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-time-selection-scope-design.md`.

Finalizing a selection drag moves the playhead to the selection start —
unless the playhead already lies inside the drawn range (edges inclusive),
in which case it stays put. Applies to spectral selections too.
